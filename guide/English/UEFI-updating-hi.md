# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## UEFI Updating
> [!Warning]
> If you are updating from the old UEFI (January 15 or before) to UEFI-V3, you also have to update your drivers, which you can do using the [driver updating guide](update-en.md)

### Why is this guide needed?

Idk, but some people were asking about it 

### Prerequisites
- [```WOA Helper app```](https://github.com/erdilS/Port-Windows-11-Xiaomi-Pad-5/releases/download/dualboot/woahelper.apk)
  
- [```Latest UEFI```](https://github.com/erdilS/Port-Windows-11-Xiaomi-Pad-5/releases/download/UEFI/uefi-v3.img)

## Replace old UEFI with the new one
> If you haven't yet set up dualboot, follow the [dualboot guide](/guide/English/dualboot-en.md) to set up the WOA Helper properly
- Boot to Android
- Open the `UEFI` folder in your internal storage
- Delete the old UEFI
- Place the new one inside

## Done, switch to Windows and enjoy 

> [!NOTE]
>  If you get a BSOD or Windows can't boot normally, make sure you're using the latest drivers and update them
